/**
 * As of writing this, the following code is the only way I managed to get the transform properties to be animatable.
 * Originally the properties lived inside `Model3DView`, but the `Animatable` protocol refused to actually
 * animate these properties. To circumvent this, the properties have been moved to Environment values and are set via
 * an `AnimatableModifier`. It works, but suggestions/improvements are welcome!
