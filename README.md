# GarmentConfigurator
ARgo is a groundbreaking iOS app developed by our team at the Apple Developer Academy, aimed at transforming the fashion industry through the power of augmented reality (AR). By enabling brand managers to rapidly prototype and visualize 3D garments in AR, we strive to enhance creativity and innovation within the sector.

The app comprises a user-friendly interface and various features, such as a Welcome Screen, Main Screen, Configurator Screen, and AR Screen. These intuitive screens facilitate effortless interaction with 3D clothing models, customization of t-shirt patterns using personal images, and the ability to virtually "try on" garments in real-time.
